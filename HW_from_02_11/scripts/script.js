// Task 4. Write a function named setAlarm/set_alarm/set-alarm/setalarm (depending on language) which receives two parameters. The first parameter, employed, is true whenever you are employed and the second parameter, vacation is true whenever you are on vacation.
// The function should return true if you are employed and not on vacation (because these are the circumstances under which you need to set an alarm). It should return false otherwise. Examples:

// Task 5. There is a bus moving in the city which takes and drops some people at each bus stop.
// You are provided with a list (or array) of integer pairs. Elements of each pair represent the number of people that get on the bus (the first item) and the number of people that get off the bus (the second item) at a bus stop.
// Your task is to return the number of people who are still on the bus after the last bus stop (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus might not be empty and some people might still be inside the bus, they are probably sleeping there :D
// Take a look on the test cases.
// Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the returned integer can't be negative.
// The second value in the first pair in the array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.

// Task 6. All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.
// Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.
// Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.

// Task 9. Write a method, that will get an integer array as parameter and will process every number from this array.
